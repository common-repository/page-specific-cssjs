Contributors: bradt
Tags: css, javascript
Requires at least: 2.0.3
Tested up to: 2.7
Stable tag: 0.1

Allows you include a seperate stylesheet and/or Javascript file for any pages on your site.

== Description ==

A very simple plugin that checks for CSS and Javascript files matching the name of the current page and automatically appends the necessary markup in the <head> to include them in the page.

It's a really handy plugin for sites that have pages with many different layouts.

== Installation ==

1. Download page-specific-cssjs.<version>.zip
2. Unzip the archive
3. Upload the page-specific-cssjs folder to your wp-content/plugins directory
4. Activate the plugin through the WordPress admin interface
5. To include a CSS and/or javascript file in a page, simply give it the same name as the page and drop it in your theme folder

For example, if you wanted a new stylesheet for the page at http://www.mydomain.com/about/ you would create a file called about.css in /wp-content/themes/yourtheme/.

Enjoy!
